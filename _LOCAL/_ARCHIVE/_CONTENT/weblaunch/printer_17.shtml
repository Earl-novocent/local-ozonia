This arrangement allows the water system to meet peak water requirements from the storage tank and, at the same time, minimize the production capacity and size of expensive pretreatment equipment. </p><p align=left>Such networks are susceptible to bacteria growth, especially when production is at a standstill and there is no exchange of water in the system. Measures must be taken to prevent contamination. With this in mind, the proliferation of bacteria colonies can be easily avoided by continually dosing the system with ozone from an electrolytic ozone generator. </p><p align=left>Ideally, the electrolytic ozone generator should be connected to the loop system on the return line near the storage tank. </p><p align=left>Installation is very simple. A low flow sidestream taken from the return line feeds the electrolytic ozone generator. This water is ozonated via a hydrogen-oxygen dissociation process and then is discharged as pure, ozonated water to the main return line where it is mixed with the bulk of the return line water. </p><p align=left>In order to attain maximum exposure, with some pipe diameters it is recommended to install a static mixer or some other means of causing flow turbulence to ensure that the two water streams are thoroughly mixed. </p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by ozonia&reg;     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
