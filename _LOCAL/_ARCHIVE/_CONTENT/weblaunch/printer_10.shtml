Here, careful selection is essential because the method chosen can easily affect the product quality and storage life. Chlorine, or its derivatives, is the most commonly used disinfectant. However, with limited effect on bacteria and the increased awareness of chlorinated by-products and associated health risks, a chlorine alternative is widely sought. </p><p align=left>Ozone gas is a very strong oxidizing agent, with an extensive track record in municipal drinking and bottled water disinfection all over the world. Given GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status in 1997 as a food disinfectant (by EPRI), the unique disinfection properties of ozone are perfectly suited to applications in the food-stuffs industry. </p><p align=left>Ozone is the triatomic form of oxygen that has been generated by recombining highly excited oxygen atoms and molecules with one another. It is a virtually colorless gas with an acrid odor and very strong oxidizing properties. </p><p align=left>The ozone molecule is only moderately stable and decays quite rapidly to form diatomic oxygen. This property makes it ideal for use in products for human consumption because it results in a product that is not only better in quality with regard to taste and smell, it is actually healthier for the consumer. </p><p align=left><a href="http://www.ozonia.com/">ozonia&reg;</a>, and its wealth of experience, with more municipal drinking water plants high-purity water installations and general industrial clients than any other ozone manufacturer, is an ideal partner to assist clients with ozone application and disinfection problems. </p><p align=left>To ensure that operators get the best possible performance and results from their state-of-the-art OZAT ozone generators, ozonia&reg; offers complete systems as well as standardized injection skids perfectly matched with the clients' requirements.</p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by ozonia&reg;     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
