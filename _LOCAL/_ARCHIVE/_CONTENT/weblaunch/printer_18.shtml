Medium pressure UV is a likely choice wherever chemical disinfection would be problematic or prohibited. </p><p align=left>Typical UV dose levels range from 30 mJ/cm2 for basic disinfection, to over 100 mJ/cm2 for wastewater reuse such as irrigation. Due to the sensitive nature of the application, equipment and process reliability are of utmost importance. </p><p align=left>The term medium pressure UV refers to the mercury vapor pressure inside the UV lamp when operating. UV energy from a medium pressure UV lamp is emitted over all wavelengths from 175 to 300 nm, depending on system design. </p><p align=left>The broad energy spectrum allows medium pressure UV systems to efficiently disinfect wastewater and reduce residual organics (TOC), with significantly fewer lamps than conventional low pressure or low pressure/high output UV systems. </p><p align=left>The advantages of Ozonia's medium pressure mercury vapor UV lamp systems include: </p><ul><li><div align=left>Higher energy density </div><li><div align=left>Stronger output below 300 nm </div><li><div align=left>Higher UVC (200-280 nm) efficiency - greater than 18 percent </div><li><div align=left>Variable lamp power available for those applications where the power needs to be adjusted </div><li><div align=left>Longer guaranteed lamp life using fewer lamps </div><li><div align=left>Ability to treat higher flowrates using a small footprint </div><li><div align=left>Highly efficient for disinfection, ozone destruction, TOC reduction, catalytic oxidation, etc. </div></li></ul><p align=left>Ozonia's closed-chamber design is ideally suited for both low head and high-pressure effluents, such as from a pressure filter. Available in a variety of configurations, the most popular systems use single or multiple 3.0 or 6.0 kW lamps. </p><p align=left>Ozonia UV systems are available in a variety of configurations from basic keypad interface with programmable relay for simple on/off operation, to sophisticated Allen-Bradley® PLC's with a touch-screen operator interface for numerous logic and control functions such as variable output, data logging and SCADA communication capability. </p><p align=left>All Ozonia UV reactors are made of 316L stainless steel construction throughout with a variety of surface finishes, inlet/outlet connections and pressure ratings, consistent with the application. </p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
