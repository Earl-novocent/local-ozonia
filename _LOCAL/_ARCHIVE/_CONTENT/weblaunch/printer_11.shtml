To remove these potential health hazards from within the system invariably results in higher-than-anticipated operating costs and customer-related concerns. </p><ul><li><div align=left>Small and medium sized communities often rely on water wells or surface water sources for potable water needs. </div><li><div align=left>Water treatment and distribution systems are designed to meet specific water quality standards and community requirements. </div><li><div align=left>The water treatment system may be publicly or privately owned and characteristically will have a limited customer base. </div></li></ul><p align=left>Consequently, there are normally limited financial resources available and this may restrict the investment required to expand or upgrade the water treatment system to meet the standards now set for potable water. </p><p align=left>The encysted bacterium Cryptosporidium is of particular significance in potable water treatment due to its virulent nature and resistance to chemical treatment. Medium-pressure UV irradiation is one proven technique for inactivating this organism. </p><p align=left><a href="http://www.ozonia.com/">Ozonia</a> provides a complete range of medium pressure UV for a variety of water and wastewater treatment applications. Primary features and benefits include: </p><ul><li><div align=left>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a simple, convenient, and environmentally acceptable process for treating potable water. </div><li><div align=left>UV units can readily be fitted to new or existing water treatment facilities. Strategic placement of properly designed and sized UV systems can solve and prevent many microbiological problems associated with potable water distribution systems. </div><li><div align=left>The UV process disinfects the source water by non-chemical means and this both minimizes microbiological contamination and enhances the efficiency of the subsequent chlorination system prior to distributing the water to the community. </div><li><div align=left>Medium pressure reactor designs are more compact than low pressure reactors, resulting in considerable space savings. </div><li><div align=left>Medium pressure systems offer high reliability due to minimal internal components and fast lamp replacement reducing system down-time during maintenance. </div></li></ul><p align=left>In addition to UV, Ozonia is world's leading supplier of ozonation equipment to satisfy all your disinfection needs. </p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
