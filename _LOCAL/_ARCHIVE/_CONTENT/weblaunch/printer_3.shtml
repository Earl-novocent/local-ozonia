This advanced oxidation process offers a powerful water treatment combination both for disinfection and for reduction of difficult organic compounds.</p><p align=left>Consider the following additional advantages of medium-pressure systems:</p><ul><li><div align=left>Compared with conventional low-pressure mercury lamp systems, the use of high intensity, medium-pressure models results in a dramatic reduction of number of lamps, space requirement, maintenance time, and installation and lamp replacement costs. </div><li><div align=left>UV radiation of broad germicidal action applied at the correct dose rate destroys the ability of pathogens to metabolize and reproduce and is successful against viruses and bacteria. </div><li><div align=left>Medium-pressure UV systems with high energy output per unit size are particularly applicable in this respect, being specifically designed for this purpose. Some units incorporate an automatic wiper with interval control to suit effluent quality. </div><li><div align=left>UV irradiation treatment eliminates the need for chemical handling and storage on site, or systems for dosing chemicals into the treatment stream. </div><li><div align=left>There are cost savings for smaller waste water treatment installations when compared with open channel technology. </div></li></ul>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
