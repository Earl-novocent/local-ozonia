As such, the water is required to have very low TOC levels measured in the low ppb range. </p><p align=left>Ozonia medium-pressure UV TOC systems provide high UV dose throughout a broad spectrum for efficient TOC reduction to low levels. UV irradiation in the UV-C (200-280nm) and V-UV (&lt;200nm) ranges will effectively oxidize the organic compounds constituting TOC by: </p><ol><li><div align=left>direct photolysis process, transforming them into ionic entities that are removable by ion exchange resin, </div><li><div align=left>OH radicals produced may freely react with organic molecules to partially ionize or fully oxidize them to CO2 and water. </div></li></ol><p align=left>An Ozonia UV TOC system positioned directly before a final mixed-bed resin polisher effectively lowers the organic loading that would otherwise consume ion exchange capacity. The UV barrier reduces regeneration and servicing frequencies while extending final membrane filter efficiencies. </p><p align=left>All Ozonia UV reactors are 316L stainless steel with a surface finish designed to suit the application. For TOC reduction, the reactor vessel is mechanically polished, electropolished and passivated. The vessel incorporates an internal baffle plate assembly, creating turbulence for radial mixing, ensuring maximum exposure to the UV irradiation. </p><p align=left>Additional benefits of Ozonia medium-pressure UV TOC systems include: </p><ul><li><div align=left>Much higher output of UV energy using a medium-pressure lamp than from multiple low-pressure lamps. </div><li><div align=left>The wide spectrum medium-pressure lamp provides total wavelength coverage at high energy levels to efficiently dissociate water and the complex organic mixtures that constitute TOC. </div><li><div align=left>Medium-pressure UV TOC also provides radiation in the germicidal range for disinfection. </div><li><div align=left>The high lower-wavelength range output of medium-pressure lamps provides powerful TOC destruction by both direct dissociation and by intermediary hydroxyl radical generation and subsequent reactions. </div><li><div align=left>Medium-pressure reactor designs are more compact than low-pressure reactors, resulting in considerable space savings. </div><li><div align=left>Medium-pressure systems offer high reliability due to minimal internal components and fast lamp replacement, reducing system down-time during maintenance. </div></li></ul>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
