With the rise in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, incidents of food-borne illness have also greatly increased in the US, drawing significant attention from researchers and authorities.&nbsp; Traditional methods revolve around the use of chemicals such as chlorine in the sanitizing of produce, specifically in rinsing and washing. Chlorine is widely used in these processes but it has a limited effect in killing bacteria on fruit and vegetables surfaces. There is also wide concern with regards to the by-products of chlorine and its effects on health and the environment. </p><p align=left>Ozone is becoming a popular alternative solution to traditional sanitizing agents and providing additional benefits. Ozone as an oxidizing agent, 1.5 times more powerful than chlorine and effective over a much wider spectrum of microorganisms. Ozone kills viruses and bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Listeria much faster than chlorine and other chemical agents and is free of chemical residues as it decomposes into simple oxygen.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p align=left>Ozone can effectively be used in several applications in the food and packing industries including the disinfection of process water, poultry chill water treatment, produce washing and rinsing, process water recycling and produce storage.</p><p align=left>Additional Reading:&nbsp;<br>  <a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/BOCpathogenreduction.pdf">BOC's ozone technology centerpiece of Fresh Mark's pathogen reduction program</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/bottling-e.pdf">Ozone for bottling applications</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/FDA-e.pdf">U.S. FDA Regulatory Approval of Ozone as an Antimicrobial Agent</a><br>The use of ozone as a disinfectant in fish hatcheries and fish farms [<a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/fish_hatcheries_cho-9522e.pdf">English</a> | <a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/fischzucht_cho-9522d.pdf">German</a>]<br><a href="http://www.ozonia.com/artman/uploads/Ozone_in_Food_Industries-e.pdf">Certification of ozone in usa food industries</a></p><!-- <p align=left>Photos;&nbsp;OZFIL; CFS</p> -->              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
