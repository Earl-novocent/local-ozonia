This is especially the true when a system is not continually replenished with fresh make-up water, such as overnight or weekends, when the water is stagnant in a tank or circulates in a system. At those times during periods of low or no flow, disinfection is essential to avoid the proliferation of bacteria colonies. </p><p align=left>There are several processes that can be used for the disinfection of pure water systems, however, each of these have distinct limitations or disadvantages when compared to ozonation with an electrolytic process: </p><p align=left><b><i>Shock disinfeciton with chemicals</i></b> </p><p align=left><b>Disadvantages:</b> </p><ul><li><div align=left>Interruption of operation </div><li><div align=left>Work intensive </div><li><div align=left>Waste chemical problems </div><li><div align=left>Water quality fluctuations </div><li><div align=left>Chemical traces </div></li></ul><p align=left><b><i>Shock sterilization with steam</i></b> </p><p align=left><b>Disadvantages:</b> </p><ul><li><div align=left>Interruption of operation </div><li><div align=left>Costly installation </div><li><div align=left>Uncontaminated steam required </div><li><div align=left>Water quality fluctuations </div></li></ul><p align=left><b><i>Ultraviolet irradiation</i></b> </p><p align=left><b>Limitations:</b> </p><ul><li><div align=left>Disinfection not always 100 percent </div><li><div align=left>Only localized effect </div><li><div align=left>Sterile filter required </div></li></ul><p align=left><b><i>Sterile filtration</i></b> </p><p align=left><b>Disadvantages:</b> </p><ul><li><div align=left>Bacteria </div><li><div align=left>Sterilization and replacement required </div><li><div align=left>Danger of bursting </div><li><div align=left>Expensive </div></li></ul><p align=left>Ozone itself is a virtually colorless gas with an acrid odor. It is one of the strongest known oxidants with an electrochemical oxidation potential of 2.08 V. The ozone molecule is only moderately stable and has a half life time of some 20 minutes in pure water at service conditions. </p><p align=left>In the absence of oxidiziale substances ozone decomposes to form oxygen - in the presence of oxidizable substances traces of CO2 will also form. </p><p align=left>Used for a broad range of applications the advantages of ozone are numerous, however, the most important of these are: </p><ul><li><div align=left>There are no objectionable by-products or residues when water is disinfected with ozone. </div><li><div align=left>No chemical traces. </div><li><div align=left>The transport and storage of potentially dangerous chemicals is not necessary because ozone is produced on site where and when it is necessary. </div><li><div align=left>The ozone production rate can be controlled by the process parameters, i.e. the required amounts of ozone are generated in order to avoid under or over dosing. </div><li><div align=left>Experience, gained over many years, shows that an average ozone concentration of ca 0.1 to 0.2 mg/l. is sufficient to keep the germ count in pure water systems below 1 per 100ml. </div></li></ul>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by Ozonia     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
