Therefore atmospheric air must be treated before it can be used. Oxygen can be generated on site by means of a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) or Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA) plant or even a combination of both VPSA.</p><p align=left>The requirements placed on such a treatment plant are: </p><ul><li><div align=left>Removal of dust particles from the air </div></li><li><div align=left>Compression of the air to the required operating pressure </div></li><li><div align=left>Drying of the air to a residual humidity corresponding to an atmospheric dew point of at least minus 60°C </div></li><li><div align=left>The treatment of the air to this standard is essential for the reliable and efficient production of ozone. </div></li></ul><p align=left>Depending on the ozone capacity the air preparation will be designed as either a low or medium pressure unit. This comprises compressor(s), after cooler(s), refrigerant dryer(s), filters and heatless or heat regenerated adsorber dryer.</p><p align=left>The adsorption technology is based on a physical separation process which uses the different adsorption properties of gases to a microporous solid substance, the so-called adsorbent. Nitrogen, for example, has a higher adsorption capacity to some zeolite molecular sieves than oxygen and can therefore be effectively separated from the air.</p><p align=left>The main equipment of a PSA plant comprises an air compressor and two adsorber vessels filled with a drying agent and molecular sieve. Each adsorber operates on an alternating cycle of adsorption and regeneration, thus a continuous flow of oxygen is achieved.<br></p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by ozonia&reg;     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
