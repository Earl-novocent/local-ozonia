One popular aspect of these facilities is the health spa or hydrotherapy pool. These facilities by their nature experience much heavier bather loading than larger pools, which in turn results in an increase in the microbiological and chemical hazards associated with the running of a safe and pleasant spa facility. </p><p align=left>Due to the small volume of water in spa systems and the increased temperature of the spa water, spas are highly susceptible to proliferation of bacteria. Adenoviruses, <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Escherichia coli 0157</i>, <i>Giardia lambia</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> are all common enteric organisms from fecal matter that must be controlled in spa environments. </p><p align=left>The most common disinfectant used is chlorine. This readily reacts with urea and other organic molecules deposited in the spa water by bathers to form disinfection by-products (DPB's), which can represent a health risk by ingestion, inhalation or adsorption via skin contact. </p><p align=left>Of the most common species of bacteria found in spas, many show resistance to chlorine-based disinfectants when dosed at practical levels. Most commonly used chlorine-based systems are difficult to operate in a manner that is reliable and efficient. Instances of detrimental effects on bather health would be catastrophic for the operation of a commercial spa facility. </p><p align=left>One novel and extremely effective type of treatment easily adapted to commercial spas is an advanced oxidation process, combining ozonation followed by UV irradiation resulting in the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which have a powerful oxidation potential. The production of hydroxyl radicals results in the oxidation of combined chlorine species within the spa water, producing carbon dioxide and water as harmless by-products. </p><p align=left>A system manufactured by ozonia&reg; Triogen Ltd., which incorporates both technologies was installed at a test facility in March of 2002. </p><p align=left>During the first 24 days there were only five backwashes. In comparison to spa operation prior to the test, the combined chlorine level was on average 72.3 percent less, the water was of higher quality and after 24 days of operation approximately 30.0 m<sup>3</sup> of water had been used. Over a four-week period an approximate 79.5 percent saving in water will have been achieved. </p><p align=left>In addition to the savings in water usage, the reduction in the organic species loading in the water due to the oxidation action of the combined process (SPAZONE 75) reduced the overall chemical required to maintain the free chlorine residual by over 25 percent.</p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by ozonia&reg;     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
