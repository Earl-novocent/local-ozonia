Tighter limits on all aspects of production processes frequently extend to the use of disinfected high purity water. </p><p align=left>For numerous applications, this high degree of purity is essential to protect the consumer, prevent product spoilage, to minimize reject levels, or to increase the shelf life of the final product. It is a universal requirement that disinfection be achieved without contamination or modification of the process or product. Continuous, in-line, automatic and fail-safe disinfection techniques with minimal maintenance are essential. </p><p align=left>For simple pre-treatment system protection, UV radiation is a viable option. Areas for consideration include the protection of carbon beds, reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration membranes from microbiological fouling. </p><p align=left>When a disinfection process, such as ozonation, is not used for loop protection, UV is used to protect against microbial contamination at points-of-use downstream. </p><p align=left>Medium pressure UV is an ideal solution to protect mixed-bed polishing resin demineralizers from microbiological contaminants passing into and proliferating within the resin beds. UV is a sure and rapid method of deozonation should electrolytic or corona discharge ozonation be employed for continuous sanitization or a periodic CIP process. </p><p align=left>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a simple, convenient and environmentally acceptable process that can be readily fitted to new or existing water treatment facilities with a minimum of disturbance of system piping. </p><ul><li><div align=left>ozonia&reg; UV systems are specifically designed for ultra pure water treatment, utilizing a specially tuned medium pressure UV lamp and a high purity quartz sleeve. </div><li><div align=left>UV disinfects the water by non-chemical means, preventing reactivation in closed water systems. </div><li><div align=left>Optimal positioning of the UV system depends on the process design. </div><li><div align=left>The reactor body is manufactured from 316 stainless steel and finished to the highest standards. </div><li><div align=left>Medium pressure systems offer high reliability due to minimal internal components and fast lamp replacement, reducing system time-down during maintenance. </div></li></ul><p align=left>For more information on this or other UV and ozone related topics, contact your nearest ozonia&reg; office or agent through our website.</p>              <br clear="all"><br>     &copy; Copyright 2004 by ozonia&reg;     <br>           </span></td></tr></table>   <!-- footer --></span></div>        </td></tr>    </table></body></html>
