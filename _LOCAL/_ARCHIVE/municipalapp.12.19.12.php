							<h3>Disinfection</h3>
							<p>Both Ozone and UV are well recognized methods for water and wastewater disinfection in the industrial and municipal markets. Each can be used for the inactivation of viruses, giardia, cryptospordium, bacteria and other microbial contaminants.</p>
							<p>UV is a proven cost effective disinfection alternative for water and wastewater, as well as numerous industrial applications. Ozonia offers several UV products for water and wastewater treatment which are fully bioassay validated with independent third party certification per recognized regulatory guidelines.</p>
							<p>In addition to disinfection, ozone is also an effective treatment for taste, odor and color removal, iron and manganese reduction, as well as being a flocculating agent.</p>
							<p>Ozone and/or UV are effective and environmentally friendly alternatives to chlorine and chlorine derivatives for water and wastewater disinfection.</p>

							<!--<p>In recent years there has been an increased focus on food safety and in particular the methods used to reduce and eliminate pathogens from fresh produce. With the rise in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, incidents of food-borne illness have also greatly increased in the US, drawing significant attention from researchers and authorities. Traditional methods revolve around the use of chemicals such as chlorine in the sanitizing of produce, specifically in rinsing and washing. Chlorine is widely used in these processes but it has a limited effect in killing bacteria on fruit and vegetables surfaces. There is also wide concern with regards to the by-products of chlorine and its effects on health and the environment.</p>
							<p>Ozone is becoming a popular alternative solution to traditional sanitizing agents and providing additional benefits. Ozone as an oxidizing agent, 1.5 times more powerful than chlorine and effective over a much wider spectrum of microorganisms. Ozone kills viruses and bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Listeria much faster than chlorine and other chemical agents and is free of chemical residues as it decomposes into simple oxygen.</p>
							<p>Ozone can effectively be used in several applications in the food and packing industries including the disinfection of process water, poultry chill water treatment, produce washing and rinsing, process water recycling and produce storage.</p>

							<h3>Color Removal</h3>
							<p>Color due to organic molecules or products break down quickly when they come into contact with ozone. The powerful oxidation potential of ozone has made color removal one of the "classic" ozone applications for drinking water along with taste and odor removal which are also organic based. This need has crossed over to wastewater treatment (industrial and municipal) and today ozone is used extensively to remove color from effluents from dye manufacturers, textile mills, pharmaceutical factories and other industrial companies.</p>
							<p>Ozone is also used extensively as a "bleach" in many processes such pulp and paper manufacturing, kaolin production and even textiles (stone washed denim). Ozonia has a broad range of products from laboratory scale ozonators to large engineered ozone plants to satisfy any possible color removal need.</p>

							<h3>Drinking Water</h3>
							<p>Both Ozone and UV are well recognized methods for municipal drinking water treatment and disinfection. Each can be used for the inactivation of viruses, giardia, cryptospordium, bacteria and other microbial contaminants. While UV is limited to disinfection, ozone is also an effective treatment for taste, odor and color removal, iron and manganese reduction, as well as being a flocculating agent. Ozone and/or UV require a relatively short residence times for disinfection unlike chemicals such as chlorine and chlorine derivatives.</p>
							<p>Drinking water is treated to kill or inactivate any pathogenic micro-organisms such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, to remove inorganic and organic trace contaminants which have found their way into the water system because of pollution and to reduce the naturally occurring organic compounds such as humic acid and algal metabolites. In general, surface waters such as lakes and rivers contain higher levels of micro-organisms and are more prone to contamination than groundwater and require different treatment regimes. To reduce the risk to consumers, more and more countries are introducing new drinking water regulations containing stricter limits on pathogens and  contaminants.</p>

							<h3>Swimming Pools</h3>
							<p>Ozone and UV are very effective alternatives to chlorine and other chemicals as a disinfection agent in swimming pools. Ozone and UV can safely prevent the formation of chlorine byproducts, such as chloramines and trihalomethanes. Ozone and UV can breakdown chlorinated byproducts, therefore reducing the typical problems associated with pools such as red eyes and respiration ailments. Ozone will also oxidize oils and other contaminants in swimming pools and spa water into safer elements. The use of ozone and UV can play an essential role in providing a clean and pleasant environment for bathers and pool staff.</p>

							<h3>Wastewater</h3>
							<p>Effluent wastewater from an industrial facility may carry a broad and variable range of contaminants, including BOD, COD, color, phenols, cyanides, sanitary waste and a host of complex chemicals. Ozone, in combination with UV and/or other physical, chemical or biological processes, has the potential to treat complex industrial wastes due to its strong oxidative nature. In combination with medium pressure UV, ozone exhibits the power of advanced oxidation for TOC reduction, as well as destruction of organics. Potential industries that can benefit from ozone and UV include  pharmaceuticals, textiles, automotive, foundry, etc.</p>
							<p>In arid areas, due to water scarcity, treated wastewater can be used for a reuse application such as land or golf irrigation. Water recycling avoids water shortages and protects water resources. Water recycling is safe, environmentally sustainable and cost-effective for decision-makers who care about environmental resources. For operating cost reduction, municipalities and industry are smart to invest in reuse installations to reduce their fresh water consumption. Ozonia and Aquasource can implement different solutions to contribute to integrated water management.</p>
